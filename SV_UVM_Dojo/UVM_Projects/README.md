## README

This is a collection of UVM Testbenches that I constructed from scratch after completing Cadence's training materials from their UVM Accelerated Verification course.
The aims of the exercises using DUTs from my personal library of FPGA DUTs
1. Become comfortable building a UVM testbench from scratch.
2. Gain confidence in understanding of protocols.
3. Get some minimal experience with syntax and common simple mistakes while creating a testbench from scratch.

   Why only some testcases for these protocols, instead of comprehensive coverage?

   This is due to the limitation of the EDA Playground that I am using.
   1. EDA Playground has a upper limit of handling not more than 10 files.
   2. Simulations cannot run beyond 1 minute.
